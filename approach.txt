files
    "runner.sh" - this file will be used to trigger a set of clients... 5 in our case
    "client.go" - this will contain the methods for making http requests
    "client1.go, client2.go,.... client5.go" - this file will hold the respective clients and there set of requests
    "server.go" - this will hold all the REST APIs (along with engine code) and will act as server

development
    stage1:
        build the "server.go"
            reddit engine
            APIs
            integrate both and test it using curl command
    stage2:
        build the "client.go"
        build each of clients... client1, client2
            only call to showreddits
    stage3:
        build "runner.sh"
            add all commands to execute above programs parallely
    stage4:
        prepare requests sequence on paper for all clients
        embed them in code of respective files
        add delays in runner.sh between each client file call
    stage5:
        compare logs of each of the go executed file
        verify if everything is going well
    stage6:
        plan for video
